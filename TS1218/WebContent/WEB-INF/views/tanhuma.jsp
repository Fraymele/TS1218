	<div>Crowdsourcing and citizen science In recent years numerous
		initiatives involving the general public in academic research have
		been developed. In general, they are called “citizen science”. In
		these initiatives the general public is invited to help in labor
		intensive tasks in a variety of domains, from categorizing galaxies to
		mapping extinct animals and even in the humanities. Crowdsourcing
		initiatives are bidirectional, they are intended not only to expose
		scientific research to the general public in an understandable manner
		and to engage the public in performing scientific research but also to
		get scientists and scholars out of their ivory tower and to deepen the
		connection and collaboration between society and academia. Tikkoun
		Sofrim is the second crowdsourcing initiative of elijah lab at the
		University of Haifa and follows its predecessor scribes of the Cairo
		Geniza Tanhuma-yelamdenu The Tanhuma yelamdenu literature belongs to
		the genre of homiletic Midrashim. They consist of homilies for all
		passages of the Torah reading cycle as it was practiced in the Land of
		Israel in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. In this reading
		cycle the Torah was read in three or three and a half years. For the
		particular readings on festivals and special Sabbaths corresponding
		homilies were added. Key features of the Tanhuma are the opening with
		a halakhic question, frequently preceding the regular openings.
		Compared to earlier exegetical midrash such as Genesis Rabba, Tanhuma
		uses less Aramaic and more Hebrew and differs in the length and style
		of the explanations. Tanhuma Yelamdenu Midrashim are found in
		different works and versions. The best known are the printed edition
		and the edition published by Buber. However also some of the Rabba
		Midrashim belong to these genre, as well as other texts found in the
		Cairo Geniza or cited in medieval anthologies. Because of the late
		nature of the Tanhuma Yelamdenu, their richness and complexity, these
		works were quite neglected and have never been published critically.
		Therefore we have chosen these texts to be the first to be dealt in
		Tikkoun Sofrim. By participating in the project you make a significant
		contribution to the accessibility of Jewish and Hebrew culture.</div>
